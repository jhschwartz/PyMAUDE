  Rotational thrombectomy devices are identified by several manufacturers.
  The primary challenge is that "argon" and "cleaner" appear in unrelated
  devices (ultrasonic cleaners, dental devices). We use specific combinations
  to minimize false positives while capturing naming variants.

  This search strategy follows PRISMA 2020 guidelines for systematic reviews
  and RECORD guidelines for code list development.

# Broad search: Cast wide net to capture variants
# Format: List of lists (OR of AND groups)
# [['term1', 'term2'], ['term3']] = (term1 AND term2) OR (term3)
broad_criteria:
  - ['argon', 'cleaner']
  - ['cleaner', '15']
  - ['thrombectomy', 'rotational']

# Narrow search: More specific criteria
# Refines broad search to reduce false positives
narrow_criteria:
  - ['argon', 'cleaner', 'thromb']
  - ['argon', 'cleaner', '15']
  - ['rex', 'cleaner']
  - ['rotational', 'thrombectomy', 'catheter']

# Known device name variants (for documentation)
# Future: Could enable fuzzy matching or brand standardization
known_variants:
  - device_name: "Argon Medical"
    generic_name: "Cleaner 15 Rotational Thrombectomy Catheter"
    manufacturer: "Rex Medical"
    canonical_id: "THROMB_001"
  - device_name: "Cleaner15"
    generic_name: ""
    manufacturer: "Argon Med"
    canonical_id: "THROMB_001"
  - device_name: "Cleaner XT"
    generic_name: "Rotational Thrombectomy System"
    manufacturer: "Argon Medical Devices"
    canonical_id: "THROMB_002"

# Exclusion patterns for known false positives
# These are substring-matched (case-insensitive) to remove irrelevant reports
exclusion_patterns:
  - "ultrasonic"
  - "dental"
  - "toothbrush"
  - "insulin pump"
  - "hearing aid"

# Manual overrides (populated during adjudication)
